# CEREBRUM

## What is Cerebrum?

Cerebrum is my "mind", eg. scrapyard for components, ideas, etc. It's a place where I can test new things, learn new things, and just have fun and maybe even get some feedback on them.

I'm planning on reusing this components across projects, so I'm trying to make them as generic as possible.

Not all of the code is mine, some are from documentations, tutorials, etc. I'm trying to give credit where it's due, but if I missed something, please let me know.
